Example resource file for CADAC web services.
Only the 3 lines at the top are read, which 
should contain
UserName     (optional URL, no spaces)
Password
ComputerName (optional URL, no spaces)

UserName is your CADAC web login, and you can followthat with a URL to
a website.

Password is you CADAC web login.

The ComputerName is the local machine name (like Cobalt or DataStar)
that will be used to identify your runs. A URL to the users docs or 
status monitor is also a good idea.
