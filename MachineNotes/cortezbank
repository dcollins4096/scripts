  got the machine.  Built some stuff.
Records spotty.  All suggested osx updates.

2014-09-24: 
  update xcode to 6.
  tried to update openssl with homebrew, which works but doesn't make the symlinks:
  """
  src>brew install openssl
  ==> Downloading https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/openssl-1.0.1i.mavericks.bottle.3.tar.gz
  ######################################################################## 100.0%
  ==> Pouring openssl-1.0.1i.mavericks.bottle.3.tar.gz
  ==> Caveats
  A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
  keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /usr/local/etc/openssl/certs

  and run
  /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash

  This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

  Mac OS X already provides this software and installing another version in
  parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

  The OpenSSL provided by OS X is too old for some software.

  Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
  own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
  build variables:

  LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
  CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include

  ==> Summary
